OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries. Our goal is to encourage networking vendors to add OpenFlow to their switch products for deployment in college campus backbones and wiring closets. We believe that OpenFlow is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on heterogeneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches. In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university network too},

  abstract   = {While machine learning and artificial intelligence have long been applied in networking research, the bulk of such works has focused on supervised learning. Recently there has been a rising trend of employing unsupervised machine learning using unstructured raw network data to improve network performance and provide services such as traffic engineering, anomaly detection, Internet traffic classification, and quality of service optimization. The interest in applying unsupervised learning techniques in networking emerges from their great success in other fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and optimal control (e.g., for developing autonomous self-driving cars). Unsupervised learning is interesting since it can unconstrain us from the need of labeled data and manual handcrafted feature engineering thereby facilitating flexible, general, and automated methods of machine learning. The focus of this survey paper is to provide an overview of the applications of unsupervised learning in the domain of networking. We provide a comprehensive survey highlighting the recent advancements in unsupervised learning techniques and describe their applications for various learning tasks in the context of networking. We also provide a discussion on future directions and open research issues, while also identifying potential pitfalls. While a few survey papers focusing on the applications of machine learning in networking have previously been published, a survey of similar scope and breadth is missing in literature. Through this paper, we advance the state of knowledge by carefully synthesizing the insights from these survey papers while also providing contemporary coverage of recent advances.},

In order to efficiently organize, manage, maintain and optimize networking systems, more intelligence needs to be deployed. However, due to the inherently distributed feature of traditional networks, machine learning techniques are hard to be applied and deployed to control and operate networks. Software defined networking (SDN) brings us new chances to provide intelligence inside the networks. The capabilities of SDN (e.g., logically centralized control, global view of the network, software-based traffic analysis, and dynamic updating of forwarding rules) make it easier to apply machine learning techniques. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the literature involving machine learning algorithms applied to SDN. First, the related works and background knowledge are introduced. Then, we present an overview of machine learning algorithms. In addition, we review how machine learning algorithms are applied in the realm of SDN, from the perspective of traffic classification, routing optimization, quality of service/quality of experience prediction, resource management and security. Finally, challenges and broader perspectives are discussed.},

The software implementation of the control plane and the built in data collection mechanisms of the OpenFlow protocol promise to be excellent tools to implement Machine Learning (ML) network control applications. A first step in that direction is to understand the type of data that can be collected in SDNs and how information can be learned from that data. In this work we describe a simple architecture deployed in an enterprise network that gathers traffic data using the OpenFlow protocol. We present the data-sets that can be obtained and show how several ML techniques can be applied to it for traffic classification.

Until now, no research has applied the TensorFlow™ deep learning neural network model to the estimation of traffic conditions.

  abstract   = {The complexity of network routing infrastructures is increased dramatically. To tackle this issue, a promising state-of-the-art paradigm called software defined networking (SDN) is introduced. Due to the differences in the network requirements of applications, QoS-aware routing plays an important role in the networks. Recent proposed resource allocation algorithms focus on the current traffic matrix which is not applicable for dynamic networks (e.g., over-the-top services). In this paper, we exploit an estimation of flow matrix which gives our scheme the ability to sufficiently reduce the total packet loss and simultaneously rises the network throughput. In this way, we mathematically formulate the QoS-aware resource allocation in software defined cloud networks using traffic prediction. The corresponding optimization problem is to minimize the maximum link utilization subject to delay, bandwidth, and flow conservations. To solve this optimization problem, two schemes are proposed: 1) exact solution and 2) fast suboptimal one. In the simulation, we first compare the two proposed schemes from accuracy and optimization time perspective. Moreover, the impact of prediction on resource allocation is discussed. In this way, it is shown that in the existence of burst traffic, our proposed scheme which exploits traffic estimation, decreases the total packet loss, more than 20 percent in compare with conventional approaches. Moreover, the total throughput increases 30 percent. The experimental results show that relaxed solution is a good approximation of optimal solution in all test cases while the optimization time of approximate algorithm is superior to the original one.},

  abstract   = {Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new networking paradigm in which the network provides users with content instead of communication channels between hosts. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an approach that promises to enable the continuous evolution of networking architectures. In this paper we propose and discuss solutions to support ICN by using SDN concepts. We focus on an ICN framework called CONET, which grounds its roots in the CCN/NDN architecture and can interwork with its implementation (CCNx). Although some details of our solution have been specifically designed for the CONET architecture, its general ideas and concepts are applicable to a class of recent ICN proposals, which follow the basic mode of operation of CCN/NDN. We approach the problem in two complementary ways. First we discuss a general and long term solution based on SDN concepts without taking into account specific limitations of SDN standards and equipment. Then we focus on an experiment to support ICN functionality over a large scale SDN testbed based on OpenFlow, developed in the context of the OFELIA European research project. The current OFELIA testbed is based on OpenFlow 1.0 equipment from a variety of vendors, therefore we had to design the experiment taking into account the features that are currently available on off-the-shelf OpenFlow equipment.},

In parallel, energy-efficient and high-security networking is of increasing importance. Network operators, and service and product providers require a new network solution to efficiently tackle the increasing demands of this changing network landscape. Software-defined networking has emerged as an efficient network technology capable of supporting the dynamic nature of future network functions and intelligent applications while lowering operating costs through simplified hardware, software, and management. In this article, the question of how to achieve a successful carrier grade network with software-defined networking is raised. Specific focus is placed on the challenges of network performance, scalability, security, and interoperability with the proposal of potential solution directions.},

In particular, we aim to assess the performance of models inspired by the existing knowledge of network modeling in comparison to generic adaptive machine learning models. To do so, we present a M/M/1-inspired ML regressor and compare its performance to a neural network.},

Interestingly, we find that service-level QoS metrics seem encoded in network statistics and it suffices to collect OpenFlow per port statistics to achieve accurate estimation at small overhead for data collection and model computation.},

  abstract     = {The ability to intelligently utilize resources to meet the need of growing diversity in services and user behavior marks the future of wireless communication systems. Intelligent wireless communications aims at enabling the system to perceive and assess the available resources, to autonomously learn to adapt to the perceived wireless environment, and to reconfigure its operating mode to maximize the utility of the available resources. The perception capability and reconfigurability are the essential features of cognitive radio while modern machine learning techniques project great potential in system adaptation. In this paper, we discuss the development of the cognitive radio technology and machine learning techniques and emphasize their roles in improving spectrum and energy utility of wireless communication systems. We describe the state-of-the-art of relevant techniques, covering spectrum sensing and access approaches and powerful machine learning algorithms that enable spectrum- and energy-efficient communications in dynamic wireless environments. We also present practical applications of these techniques and identify further research challenges in cognitive radio and machine learning as applied to the existing and future wireless communication systems.},

  abstract    = {Next-generation wireless networks must support ultra-reliable, low-latency communication and intelligently manage a massive number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in real-time, within a highly dynamic environment. This need for stringent communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements as well as mobile edge and core intelligence can only be realized by integrating fundamental notions of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning across the wireless infrastructure and end-user devices. In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive tutorial that introduces the main concepts of machine learning, in general, and artificial neural networks (ANNs), in particular, and their potential applications in wireless communications. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive overview on a number of key types of neural networks that include feed-forward, recurrent, spiking, and deep neural networks. For each type of neural network, we present the basic architecture and training procedure, as well as the associated challenges and opportunities. Then, we provide an in-depth overview on the variety of wireless communication problems that can be addressed using ANNs, ranging from communication using unmanned aerial vehicles to virtual reality and edge caching.For each individual application, we present the main motivation for using ANNs along with the associated challenges while also providing a detailed example for a use case scenario and outlining future works that can be addressed using ANNs. In a nutshell, this article constitutes one of the first holistic tutorials on the development of machine learning techniques tailored to the needs of future wireless networks.},

The community, after many years of research, still faces the problem of building reliable and efficient IDS that are capable of handling large quantities of data, with changing patterns in real time situations. The work presented in this manuscript classifies intrusion detection systems (IDS). Moreover, a taxonomy and survey of shallow and deep networks intrusion detection systems is presented based on previous and current works. This taxonomy and survey reviews machine learning techniques and their performance in detecting anomalies. Feature selection which influences the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) IDS is discussed to explain the role of feature selection in the classification and training phase of ML IDS. Finally, a discussion of the false and true positive alarm rates is presented to help researchers model reliable and efficient machine learning based intrusion detection systems.},

  abstract   = {We present SwitchBlade, a platform for rapidly deploying custom protocols on programmable hardware. SwitchBlade uses a pipeline-based design that allows individual hardware modules to be enabled or disabled on the fly, integrates software exception handling, and provides support for forwarding based on custom header fields. SwitchBlade's ease of programmability and wire-speed performance enables rapid prototyping of custom data-plane functions that can be directly deployed in a production network. SwitchBlade integrates common packet-processing functions as hardware modules, enabling different protocols to use these functions without having to resynthesize hardware. SwitchBlade's customizable forwarding engine supports both longest-prefix matching in the packet header and exact matching on a hash value. SwitchBlade's software exceptions can be invoked based on either packet or flow-based rules and updated quickly at runtime, thus making it easy to integrate more flexible forwarding function into the pipeline. SwitchBlade also allows multiple custom data planes to operate in parallel on the same physical hardware, while providing complete isolation for protocols running in parallel. We implemented SwitchBlade using NetFPGA board, but SwitchBlade can be implemented with any FPGA. To demonstrate SwitchBlade's flexibility, we use SwitchBlade to implement and evaluate a variety of custom network protocols: we present instances of IPv4, IPv6, Path Splicing, and an OpenFlow switch, all running in parallel while forwarding packets at line rate.},

  abstract   = {A flexible and programmable forwarding plane is essential to maximize the value of Software-Defined Networks (SDN). In this paper, we propose Protocol-Oblivious Forwarding (POF) as a key enabler for highly flexible and programmable SDN. Our goal is to remove any dependency on protocol-specific configurations on the forwarding elements and enhance the data-path with new stateful instructions to support genuine software defined networking behavior. A generic flow instruction set (FIS) is defined to fulfill this purpose. POF helps to lower network cost by using commodity forwarding elements and to create new value by enabling numerous innovative network services. We built both hardware-based and open source software-based prototypes to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of POF. We report the preliminary evaluation results and the insights we learnt from the experiments. POF is future-proof and expressive. We believe it represents a promising direction to evolve the OpenFlow protocol and the future SDN forwarding elements.},

  abstract   = {Software Defined Networking envisions smart centralized controllers governing the forwarding behavior of dumb low-cost switches. But are dumb switches an actual strategic choice, or (at least to some extent) are they a consequence of the lack of viable alternatives to OpenFlow as programmatic data plane forwarding interface? Indeed, some level of (programmable) control logic in the switches might be beneficial to offload logically centralized controllers (de facto complex distributed systems) from decisions just based on local states (versus network-wide knowledge), which could be handled at wire speed inside the device itself. Also, it would reduce the amount of flow processing tasks currently delegated to specialized middleboxes. The underlying challenge is: can we devise a stateful data plane programming abstraction (versus the stateless OpenFlow match/action table) which still entails high performance and remains consistent with the vendors' preference for closed platforms? We posit that a promising answer revolves around the usage of extended finite state machines, as an extension (super-set) of the OpenFlow match/action abstraction. We concretely turn our proposed abstraction into an actual table-based API, and, perhaps surprisingly, we show how it can be supported by (mostly) reusing core primitives already implemented in OpenFlow devices.},

Thus, a high performance East-West Bridge with full mesh connection is proposed in this paper for heterogeneous NOSes to exchange network views in enterprise, data center, and intra-domain networks. We implemented the East-West Bridge and analyzed the performance obtained: about 100\% of enterprises and data centers, and about 99.5\% of autonomous systems can adopt the East-West Bridge solution.},

In this paper, we propose and implement a Communication Interface for Distributed Control plane (CIDC) that allows synchronization, the exchange of notifications as well as services between multiple distributed SDN Controllers. We have implemented distributed services such as Firewall and Load Balancer to improve the security and overall quality of service in distributed SDN architecture. The proposal for this research was evaluated in real wide-area network topologies, and the results show the feasibility of our CIDC in term of performance compared to the previous models based on a set of controllers arranged in a cluster.},

  abstract = {Since the appearance of OpenFlow back in 2008, software-defined networking (SDN) has gained momentum. Although there are some discrepancies between the standards developing organizations working with SDN about what SDN is and how it is defined, they all outline traffic engineering (TE) as a key application. One of the most common objectives of TE is the congestion minimization, where techniques such as traffic splitting among multiple paths or advanced reservation systems are used. In such a scenario, this manuscript surveys the role of a comprehensive list of SDN protocols in TE solutions, in order to assess how these protocols can benefit TE. The SDN protocols have been categorized using the SDN architecture proposed by the open networking foundation, which differentiates among data-controller plane interfaces, application-controller plane interfaces, and management interfaces, in order to state how the interface type in which they operate influences TE. In addition, the impact of the SDN protocols on TE has been evaluated by comparing them with the path computation element (PCE)-based architecture. The PCE-based architecture has been selected to measure the impact of SDN on TE because it is the most novel TE architecture until the date, and because it already defines a set of metrics to measure the performance of TE solutions. We conclude that using the three types of interfaces simultaneously will result in more powerful and enhanced TE solutions, since they benefit TE in complementary ways.},

  abstract   = {Software defined networking (SDN) decouples the network control and data planes. The network intelligence and state are logically centralized and the underlying network infrastructure is abstracted from applications. SDN enhances network security by means of global visibility of the network state where a conflict can be easily resolved from the logically centralized control plane. Hence, the SDN architecture empowers networks to actively monitor traffic and diagnose threats to facilitates network forensics, security policy alteration, and security service insertion. The separation of the control and data planes, however, opens security challenges, such as man-in-the middle attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and saturation attacks. In this paper, we analyze security threats to application, control, and data planes of SDN. The security platforms that secure each of the planes are described followed by various security approaches for network-wide security in SDN. SDN security is analyzed according to security dimensions of the ITU-T recommendation, as well as, by the costs of security solutions. In a nutshell, this paper highlights the present and future security challenges in SDN and future directions for secure SDN.},

SDN has the capability to adapt its network parameters on the fly based on its operating environment. The decoupled structure of SDN serves as a solution for managing the network with more flexibility and ease. In SDN, the centralized cost effective architecture provides network visibility which helps to achieve efficient resource utilization and high performance. Due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart programmable devices in the network, SDN provides security, energy efficiency, and network virtualization for enhancing the overall network performance. We present various security threats that are resolved by SDN and new threats that arise as a result of SDN implementation. The recent security attacks and countermeasures in SDN are also summarized in the form of tables. We also provide a survey on the different strategies that are implemented to achieve energy efficiency and network security through SDN implementation. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts, challenges, and research trends in this area. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of SDN architecture, different security attacks and countermeasures, and energy efficiency.},

  abstract   = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in cloud computing environments are growing due to the essential characteristics of cloud computing. With recent advances in software-defined networking (SDN), SDN-based cloud brings us new chances to defeat DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments. Nevertheless, there is a contradictory relationship between SDN and DDoS attacks. On one hand, the capabilities of SDN, including software-based traffic analysis, centralized control, global view of the network, dynamic updating of forwarding rules, make it easier to detect and react to DDoS attacks. On the other hand, the security of SDN itself remains to be addressed, and potential DDoS vulnerabilities exist across SDN platforms. In this paper, we discuss the new trends and characteristics of DDoS attacks in cloud computing, and provide a comprehensive survey of defense mechanisms against DDoS attacks using SDN. In addition, we review the studies about launching DDoS attacks on SDN, as well as the methods against DDoS attacks in SDN. To the best of our knowledge, the contradictory relationship between SDN and DDoS attacks has not been well addressed in previous works. This work can help to understand how to make full use of SDN's advantages to defeat DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments and how to prevent SDN itself from becoming a victim of DDoS attacks, which are important for the smooth evolution of SDN-based cloud without the distraction of DDoS attacks.},

  abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) emerged as an attempt to introduce network innovations faster, and to radically simplify and automate the management of large networks. SDN traditionally leverages Open Flow as device-level abstraction. Since OpenFlow permits the programmer to “just” abstract a static flow-table, any stateful control and processing intelligence is necessarily delegated to the network controller. Motivated by the latency and signaling overhead that comes along with such a two-tiered SDN programming model, in the last couple of years several works have proposed innovative switch-level (data plane) programming abstractions capable to deploy some smartness directly inside the network switches, e.g., in the form of localized stateful flow processing. Furthermore, the possible inclusion of states and state maintenance primitives inside the switches is currently being debated in the OpenFlow standardization community itself. In this paper, after having provided the reader with a background on such emerging stateful SDN data plane proposals, we focus our attention on the security implications that data plane programmability brings about. Also via the identification of potential attack scenarios, we specifically highlight possible vulnerabilities specific to stateful in-switch processing (including denial of service and saturation attacks), which we believe should be carefully taken into consideration in the ongoing design of current and future proposals for stateful SDN data planes.},

  abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that has become increasingly popular in recent years. The core idea is to separate the control and data planes, allowing the construction of network applications using high-level abstractions that are translated to network devices through a southbound interface. SDN architecture is composed of three layers: 1) infrastructure layer, responsible exclusively for data forwarding; 2) control layer, which maintains the network view and provides core network abstractions; and 3) application layer, which uses abstractions provided by the control layer to implement network applications. SDN provides features, such as flexibility and programmability, that are key enablers to meet current network requirements (e.g., multi-tenant cloud networks and elastic optical networks). However, along with its benefits, SDN also brings new issues. In this survey we focus on issues related to fault management. Different fault management threat vectors are introduced by each layer, as well as by the interface between layers. Nevertheless, besides addressing fault management issues of its architecture, SDN also must handle the same problems faced by legacy networks. However, programmability and centralized management might be used to provide flexibility to deal with those issues. This paper presents an overview of fault management in SDN. The major contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) identification of the main fault management issues in SDN and classification according to the affected layers; 2) survey of efforts that address those issues and classification according to the affected planes, issues concerned, general approaches, and features; and 3) discussion about tradeoffs of different approaches and their suitability for different scenarios.},

  abstract   = {A variety of communication networks, such as industrial communication systems, have to provide strict delay guarantees to the carried flows. Fast and close to optimal quality of service (QoS) routing algorithms, e.g., delay-constrained leastcost (DCLC) routing algorithms, are required for routing flows in such networks with strict delay requirements. The emerging software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm centralizes the network control in SDN controllers that can centrally execute QoS routing algorithms. A wide range of QoS routing algorithms have been proposed in the literature and examined in individual studies. However, a comprehensive evaluation framework and quantitative comparison of QoS routing algorithms that can serve as a basis for selecting and further advancing QoS routing in SDN networks is missing in the literature. This makes it difficult to select the most appropriate QoS routing algorithm for a particular use case, e.g., for SDN controlled industrial communications. We close this gap in the literature by conducting a comprehensive up-to-date survey of centralized QoS routing algorithms. We introduce a novel four-dimensional (4D) evaluation framework for QoS routing algorithms, whereby the 4D correspond to the type of topology, two forms of scalability of a topology, and the tightness of the delay constraint. We implemented 26 selected DCLC algorithms and compared their runtime and cost inefficiency within the 4D evaluation framework. While the main conclusion of this evaluation is that the best algorithm depends on the specific sub-space of the 4D space that is targeted, we identify two algorithms, namely Lagrange relaxation-based aggregated cost (LARAC) and search space reduction delay-cost-constrained routing (SSR+DCCR), that perform very well in most of the 4D evaluation space.},

The alarms of change are set, and software define networking (SDN) is coming to the rescue with the promise of reducing capital expenditures and operational expenses. Driven by economic needs and network innovation facilities, today transport SDN (T-SDN) is a reality. It gained big momentum in the last years, however, in the networking industry, the transport network will be perhaps the last segment to embrace SDN, mainly due to the heterogeneous nature and complexity of the optical equipment composing it. This survey guides the reader through a fascinating technological adventure that provides an organic analysis of the T-SDN development and evolution considering contributions from: academic research, standardization bodies, industrial development, open source projects, and alliances among them. After creating a comprehensive picture of T-SDN, we provide an analysis of many open issues that are expected to need significant future work, and give our vision in this path toward a fully programmable and dynamic transport network.},

Applications interact with controllers to implement network services, such as network transport with quality of service. SDN facilitates the virtualization of network functions so that multiple virtual networks can operate over a given installed physical network infrastructure. Due to the specific characteristics of optical (photonic) communication components and the high optical transmission capacities, SDN-based optical networking poses particular challenges, but holds also great potential. In this article, we comprehensively survey studies that examine the SDN paradigm in optical networks; in brief, we survey the area of software defined optical networks (SDONs). We mainly organize the SDON studies into studies focused on the infrastructure layer, the control layer, and the application layer. Moreover, we cover SDON studies focused on network virtualization, as well as SDON studies focused on the orchestration of multilayer and multidomain networking. Based on the survey, we identify open challenges for SDONs and outline future directions.},

  abstract   = {One of the primary architectural principles behind the Internet is the use of distributed protocols, which facilitates fault tolerance and distributed management. Unfortunately, having nodes (i.e., switches and routers) perform control decisions independently makes it difficult to control the network or even understand or debug its overall emergent behavior. As a result, networks are often inefficient, unstable, and fragile. This Internet architecture also poses a significant, often insurmountable, challenge to the deployment of new protocols and evolution of existing ones. Software defined networking (SDN) is a recent networking architecture with promising properties relative to these weaknesses in traditional networks. SDN decouples the control plane, which makes the network forwarding decisions, from the data plane, which mainly forwards the data. This decoupling enables more centralized control where coordinated decisions directly guide the network to desired operating conditions. Moreover, decoupling the control enables graceful evolution of protocols, and the deployment of new protocols without having to replace the data plane switches. In this survey, we review recent work that leverages SDN in wireless network settings, where they are not currently widely adopted or well understood. More specifically, we evaluate the use of SDN in four classes of popular wireless networks: cellular, sensor, mesh, and home networks. We classify the different advantages that can be obtained by using SDN across this range of networks, and hope that this classification identifies unexplored opportunities for using SDN to improve the operation and performance of wireless networks.},

In this respect, we provide a comprehensive survey of different SDN-based technologies, which are useful to fulfill the requirements of IoT, from different networking aspects-edge, access, core, and data center networking. In these areas, the utility of SDN-based technologies is discussed, while presenting different challenges and requirements of the same in the context of IoT applications.

  abstract   = {A novel paradigm that changes the scene for the modern communication and computation systems is the Edge Computing. It is not a coincidence that terms like Mobile Cloud Computing, Cloudlets, Fog Computing, and Mobile-Edge Computing are gaining popularity both in academia and industry. In this paper, we embrace all these terms under the umbrella concept of “Edge Computing” to name the trend where computational infrastructures hence the services themselves are getting closer to the end user. However, we observe that bringing computational infrastructures to the proximity of the user does not magically solve all technical challenges. Moreover, it creates complexities of its own when not carefully handled. In this paper, these challenges are discussed in depth and categorically analyzed. As a solution direction, we propose that another major trend in networking, namely software-defined networking (SDN), should be taken into account. SDN, which is not proposed specifically for Edge Computing, can in fact serve as an enabler to lower the complexity barriers involved and let the real potential of Edge Computing be achieved. To fully demonstrate our ideas, initially, we put forward a clear collaboration model for the SDN-Edge Computing interaction through practical architectures and show that SDN related mechanisms can feasibly operate within the Edge Computing infrastructures. Then, we provide a detailed survey of the approaches that comprise the Edge Computing domain. A comparative discussion elaborates on where these technologies meet as well as how they differ. Later, we discuss the capabilities of SDN and align them with the technical shortcomings of Edge Computing implementations. We thoroughly investigate the possible modes of operation and interaction between the aforementioned technologies in all directions and technically deduce a set of “Benefit Areas” which is discussed in detail. Lastly, as SDN is an evolving technology, we give the future directions for enhancing the SDN development so that it can take this collaboration to a further level.},

  abstract   = {Diverse proprietary network appliances increase both the capital and operational expense of service providers, meanwhile causing problems of network ossification. Network function virtualization (NFV) is proposed to address these issues by implementing network functions as pure software on commodity and general hardware. NFV allows flexible provisioning, deployment, and centralized management of virtual network functions. Integrated with SDN, the software-defined NFV architecture further offers agile traffic steering and joint optimization of network functions and resources. This architecture benefits a wide range of applications (e.g., service chaining) and is becoming the dominant form of NFV. In this survey, we present a thorough investigation of the development of NFV under the software-defined NFV architecture, with an emphasis on service chaining as its application. We first introduce the software-defined NFV architecture as the state of the art of NFV and present relationships between NFV and SDN. Then, we provide a historic view of the involvement from middlebox to NFV. Finally, we introduce significant challenges and relevant solutions of NFV, and discuss its future research directions by different application domains.},

Moreover, wireless network virtualization can provide easier migration to newer products or technologies by isolating part of the network. Despite the potential vision of wireless network virtualization, several significant research challenges remain to be addressed before widespread deployment of wireless network virtualization, including isolation, control signaling, resource discovery and allocation, mobility management, network management and operation, and security as well as non-technical issues such as governance regulations, etc. In this paper, we provide a brief survey on some of the works that have already been done to achieve wireless network virtualization, and discuss some research issues and challenges.

  abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) has recently gained unprecedented attention from industry and research communities, and it seems unlikely that this will be attenuated in the near future. The ideas brought by SDN, although often described as a “revolutionary paradigm shift” in networking, are not completely new since they have their foundations in programmable networks and control-data plane separation projects. SDN promises simplified network management by enabling network automation, fostering innovation through programmability, and decreasing CAPEX and OPEX by reducing costs and power consumption. In this paper, we aim at analyzing and categorizing a number of relevant research works toward realizing SDN promises. We first provide an overview on SDN roots and then describe the architecture underlying SDN and its main components. Thereafter, we present existing SDN-related taxonomies and propose a taxonomy that classifies the reviewed research works and brings relevant research directions into focus. We dedicate the second part of this paper to studying and comparing the current SDN-related research initiatives and describe the main issues that may arise due to the adoption of SDN. Furthermore, we review several domains where the use of SDN shows promising results. We also summarize some foreseeable future research challenges.},

  abstract = {Emerging mega-trends (e.g., mobile, social, cloud, and big data) in information and communication technologies (ICT) are commanding new challenges to future Internet, for which ubiquitous accessibility, high bandwidth, and dynamic management are crucial. However, traditional approaches based on manual configuration of proprietary devices are cumbersome and error-prone, and they cannot fully utilize the capability of physical network infrastructure. Recently, software-defined networking (SDN) has been touted as one of the most promising solutions for future Internet. SDN is characterized by its two distinguished features, including decoupling the control plane from the data plane and providing programmability for network application development. As a result, SDN is positioned to provide more efficient configuration, better performance, and higher flexibility to accommodate innovative network designs. This paper surveys latest developments in this active research area of SDN. We first present a generally accepted definition for SDN with the aforementioned two characteristic features and potential benefits of SDN. We then dwell on its three-layer architecture, including an infrastructure layer, a control layer, and an application layer, and substantiate each layer with existing research efforts and its related research areas. We follow that with an overview of the de facto SDN implementation (i.e., OpenFlow). Finally, we conclude this survey paper with some suggested open research challenges.},

SDN achieves easy repolicing by decoupling the control plane from data plane. Thus, the network routers/switches just simply forward packets by following the flow table rules set by the control plane. Currently, OpenFlow is the most popular SDN protocol/standard and has a set of design specifications. Although SDN/OpenFlow is a relatively new area, it has attracted much attention from both academia and industry. In this paper, we will conduct a comprehensive survey of the important topics in SDN/OpenFlow implementation, including the basic concept, applications, language abstraction, controller, virtualization, quality of service, security, and its integration with wireless and optical networks. We will compare the pros and cons of different schemes and discuss the future research trends in this exciting area.

  abstract   = {Network devices have always been considered as configurable black boxes until the emergence of software-defined networking (SDN). SDN enables the networks to be programmed according to the user requirements; furthermore, it allows the network to be easily modified to suit transient demands. However, how do we program the network? SDN-compliant switches offer a low-level interface that makes programming error-prone. The controllers provide application programming interfaces, but still low-level, limited, and inflexible. High-level languages have the potential to be a better alternative to program the network. There exist several SDN programming languages implementing different sets of functionalities, and focusing on solving various issues. In face of all this diversity, no published paper outlines a pragmatic view allowing to compare the SDN languages. This paper presents a systematic survey of up-to-date OpenFlow-based SDN programming languages. Our approach relies on a taxonomy comprising all prominent features found in those languages. A detailed review of the existing works is carried out investigating the foundational parts of the languages with their contributions. Examples are discussed to illustrate the fundamental abstractions. Last, all gathered information is summarized, discussing the main ongoing research efforts and challenges. Future abstractions and features to be incorporated into the next generations of SDN programming languages are also considered.},

  abstract = {Software defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a promising paradigm for making the control of communication networks flexible. SDN separates the data packet forwarding plane, i.e., the data plane, from the control plane and employs a central controller. Network virtualization allows the flexible sharing of physical networking resources by multiple users (tenants). Each tenant runs its own applications over its virtual network, i.e., its slice of the actual physical network. The virtualization of SDN networks promises to allow networks to leverage the combined benefits of SDN networking and network virtualization and has therefore attracted significant research attention in recent years. A critical component for virtualizing SDN networks is an SDN hypervisor that abstracts the underlying physical SDN network into multiple logically isolated virtual SDN networks (vSDNs), each with its own controller. We comprehensively survey hypervisors for SDN networks in this paper. We categorize the SDN hypervisors according to their architecture into centralized and distributed hypervisors. We furthermore sub-classify the hypervisors according to their execution platform into hypervisors running exclusively on general-purpose compute platforms, or on a combination of general-purpose compute platforms with general- or special-purpose network elements. We exhaustively compare the network attribute abstraction and isolation features of the existing SDN hypervisors. As part of the future research agenda, we outline the development of a performance evaluation framework for SDN hypervisors.},

The fourth edition offers a new chapter on deep learning that discusses training, regularizing, and structuring deep neural networks such as convolutional and generative adversarial networks; new material in the chapter on reinforcement learning that covers the use of deep networks, the policy gradient methods, and deep reinforcement learning; new material in the chapter on multilayer perceptrons on autoencoders and the word2vec network; and discussion of a popular method of dimensionality reduction, t-SNE. New appendixes offer background material on linear algebra and optimization. End-of-chapter exercises help readers to apply concepts learned. Introduction to Machine Learning can be used in courses for advanced undergraduate and graduate students and as a reference for professionals.},

  abstract = {The nearest neighbor decision rule assigns to an unclassified sample point the classification of the nearest of a set of previously classified points. This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of errorRof such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of errorR{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast–the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in theM-category case thatR{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast {\textbackslash}leq R {\textbackslash}leq R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast(2 –MR{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast/(M-1)), where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.},

Performance comparison with previous studies is presented in order to demonstrate the proposed algorithm's advantages over various classification methods. The goal of the paper is to provide the grasp of a methodology that can be efficiently used to raise classification success rates obtained by the use of conventional approaches such as Neural Networks, RBF networks and K-nearest neighbors. The suggested algorithm divides the training set into two subsets: one that arises from the joining of coherent data regions and one that comprises of the data portion that is difficult to be clustered. Consequently, the first subset is used to train a Support Vector Machine with a RBF kernel and the second subset is used to train another Support Vector Machine with a polynomial kernel. During classification the algorithm is capable of identifying which of the two Support Vector Machine models to use. The intuition behind the suggested algorithm relies on the expectation that the RBF Support Vector Machine model is more appropriate to use on data sets of different characteristics than the polynomial kernel. In the specific study case the suggested algorithm raised average classification success rate to 82.2\% while the best performance obtained by previous studies was 81\% given by a fine tuned highly complex ARTMAP-IC model.},

Until the 1990's it was a purely theoretical analysis of the problem of function estimation from a given collection of data. In the middle of the 1990's new types of learning algorithms (called support vector machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions for generalization which are more general than those discussed in classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation problems.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has gained popularity in a variety of computer vision tasks. Recently, it has also been successfully applied for hyperspectral image classification tasks. Training deep neural networks, such as a convolutional neural network for classification requires a large number of labeled samples. However, in remote sensing applications, we usually only have a small amount of labeled data for training because they are expensive to collect, although we still have abundant unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose semi-supervised deep learning for hyperspectral image classification-our approach uses limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data to train a deep neural network. More specifically, we use deep convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNN) for hyperspectral image classification by treating each hyperspectral pixel as a spectral sequence. In the proposed semi-supervised learning framework, the abundant unlabeled data are utilized with their pseudo labels (cluster labels). We propose to use all the training data together with their pseudo labels to pre-train a deep CRNN, and then fine-tune using the limited available labeled data. Further, to utilize spatial information in the hyperspectral images, we propose a constrained Dirichlet process mixture model (C-DPMM), a non-parametric Bayesian clustering algorithm, for semi-supervised clustering which includes pairwise must-link and cannot-link constraints-this produces high-quality pseudo-labels, resulting in improved initialization of the deep neural network. We also derived a variational inference model for the C-DPMM for efficient inference. Experimental results with real hyperspectral image data sets demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised learning methods for hyperspectral classification.},

  abstract   = {The significantly expanded and updated new edition of a widely used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence.Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {This tutorial provides an overview of the basic theory of hidden Markov models (HMMs) as originated by L.E. Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

  abstract = {A novel method based on the Hidden Markov Model is proposed to predict multistep attacks using IDS alerts. We consider the hidden states as similar phases of a particular type of attack. As a result, it can be easily adapted to multistep attacks and foresee the next steps of an attacker. To achieve this goal, a preliminary off-line training phase based on observations will be required. These observations are obtained by matching the IDS alert information with a database previously built for this purpose using a clusterization method from the CVE global database to avoid overfitting. The training model is performed using both unsupervised and supervised algorithms. Once the training is completed and probability matrices are computed, the prediction module compute the best state sequence based on the state probability for each step of the multistep attack in progress using the Viterbi and forward-backward algorithms. The training model includes the mean number of alerts and the number of alerts in progress to assist in obtaining the final attack probability. The model is analyzed for DDoS phases because it is a great problem in all Internet services. The proposed method is validated into a virtual DDoS scenario using current vulnerabilities. The results proving the system's ability to perform real-time prediction.},

  abstract  = {Since the second edition of this book came out in early 1997, the number of scientific papers published on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) has increased from about 1500 to some 4000. Also, two special workshops dedicated to the SOM have been organized, not to mention numerous SOM sessions in neural network conferences. In view of this growing interest it was felt desirable to make extensive revisions to this book. They are of the following nature. Statistical pattern analysis has now been approached more carefully than earlier. A more detailed discussion of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, which are the type usually encountered in statistics, has been included in Sect. 1.1.3: also, new probabilistic concepts, such as factor analysis, have been discussed in Sect. 1.3.1. A survey of projection methods (Sect. 1.3.2) has been added, in order to relate the SOM to classical paradigms. Vector Quantization is now discussed in one main section, and derivation of the point density of the codebook vectors using the calculus of variations has been added, in order to familiarize the reader with this otherwise com plicated statistical analysis. It was also felt that the discussion of the neural-modeling philosophy should include a broader perspective of the main issues. A historical review in Sect. 2.2, and the general philosophy in Sects. 2.3, 2.5 and 2.14 are now expected to especially help newcomers to orient themselves better amongst the profusion of contemporary neural models.},
