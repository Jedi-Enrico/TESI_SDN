\chapter{Conclusion} 
In this paper a new methodology to derive accurate models for priority queueing in Software Defined Networks, in order to enable the application of advanced optimization techniques such as MPC, has been developed and validated over the Mininet network emulator framework. The obtained simulative results validate the prediction accuracy both of the incoming traffic and of the input/output behavior of a switch device in a SDN-based network. They also provide promising insights on the potential impact of predictive models combined with MPC in terms of packet losses reduction and bandwidth savings in real networks. In future work it has been planned to validate these results over real network devices, instead of using Mininet.
