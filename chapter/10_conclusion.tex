\chapter*{Conclusion} 
In this work a new methodology to derive accurate models for priority queueing in Software Defined Networks, in order to enable the application of advanced optimization techniques such as MPC, has been developed and validated over the Mininet network emulator framework and over a dedicated hardware network. The obtained results validate the prediction accuracy both of the incoming traffic and of the input/output behavior of a switch device in a SDN-based network. They also provide promising insights on the potential impact of predictive models combined with MPC in terms of packet losses reduction and bandwidth savings. Furthermore, it has been shown that this method obtains excellent prediction results on data coming from a real network of an Italian internet provider (Sonicatel s.r.l.), proving that the proposed control would be very useful to current communications networks to guarantee the required QoS. In future work it has been planned to validate the proposed controller over real network devices, instead of using Mininet.
